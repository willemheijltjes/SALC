We prove confluence modulo the equations and preservation of beta-strong normalisation (PSN) by means of an auxiliary substitution calculus. The proof of confluence relies on M-developments, a new notion of development for $\lambda$-terms.",

abstract = "Church's lambda-calculus is modified by introducing a new mechanism, the lambda-bar operator #, which neutralizes the effect of one preceding lambda binding. This operator can be used in such a way that renaming of bound variables in any reduction sequence can be avoided, with the effect that efficient interpreters with comparatively simple machine organization can be designed. It is shown that any semantic model of the pure λ-calculus also serves as a model of this modified reduction calculus, which guarantees smooth semantic theories. The Berkling Reduction Language (BRL) is a new functional programming language based upon this modification."

abstract = "Combinatory logic claims to do the same work as λ-calculus but with a simpler language and a simpler reduction process. In a sense this claim is true: the classical reduction process in λ-calculus is indeed more complex than that in Combinatory logic. But by changing its definition only slightly one can define in λ-calculus a perfect analogue of combinatory reduction. This analogue was first formulated 30 years ago but it is still not as well known as it deserves, so in the present purely expository paper we shall try to make it more accessible. We shall discuss its definition, motivation and its neat relation to substitution."

abstract="Closed reductions in the $\lambda$-calculus is a strategy for a calculus of explicit substitutions which overcomes many of the usual syntactical problems of substitution. This is achieved by only moving closed substitutions through certain constructs, which gives a weak form of reduction, but is rich enough to capture the usual strategies in the $\lambda$-calculus (call-by-value, call-by-need, etc.) and is adequate for the evaluation of programs. An interesting point is that the calculus permits substitutions to move through abstractions, and reductions are allowed under abstractions, if certain conditions hold. The calculus naturally provides an efficient notion of reduction (with a high degree of sharing), which can easily be implemented.",
